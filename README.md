    _ The first Chapter.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * ¶Through ſlouthfulnes the balkes of the houſe decaye, and through Idle handes, it rayneth into the houſe.

      * With laughing thei get their liuing, and wyne maketh them meary.

      * Wyne maketh them meary.

      * But vnto mony all thinges are obedient.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * For the foules of heauen ſhall carry thy voyce, and they which haue winges ſhall bewray it.

      * Caſt thy breade vpon the waters, for after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it.

      * For after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it.

      * He that obſerueth the wynde ſhall not ſowe, and he that regardeth the Cloudes ſhall not reape.

      * As thou knoweſt not which is the waye of the Spirites, nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with Childe: So thou knoweſt not the worde of God that worketh all.

      * And how the bones be ioyned together.

      * In the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and

      * Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes, to ſee the Sunne.

      * Though a man lyue many yeares, and in them all reioyce, yet he ſhall remember the dayes of darkenes, becauſe they are many, all that commeth is vanitie.

      * Be meary therfore O young man in thine youth, and let thine hart be glad in thine young daies.

      * Let thyne hart be glad.

      * Walke in the wayes of thyne hart,

      * And walk in the ſight of thine eyes

      * Put away greefe out of thyne hart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſhe: for childehode and youth are vanitie.

      * Put away euill from thy fleſhe.

      * For childehode and youth. &c.

      * ¶ Remember thy Creator now in thine youth, before the euell dayes come, & the yeares approch: where in thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

      * Whiles the ſonne is not darke, nor the light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, nor the Cloudes, returne after the rayne.

      * ¶ When the Reapers of the houſe ſhall tremble.

      * ❀And the ſtrong men ſhall bowe them ſelues.

      * When the Grinders ſhall ceaſe, becauſe

they are fewe.

      * ¶ And they waxe darke that looke out at the wyndowes.

      * And the ſtreat dores be ſhut without, & the baſe ſounde of the grinding waxe weake.

      * When they ſhall ryſe at the peping of the byrde, and all the daughters of ſinging ſhall waxe fainte.

      * The daughters of ſinging.

      * When the height ſhalbe afrayed, &

feare in the waye.

      * ¶ When the Almonde Tree ſhall floriſh.

      * ❀ When the Graſhopper ſhall be a burthen.

      * When pleaſure and delight abateth

      * For man ſhall goe into the houſe of his age, and the mourners ſhall goe about in the ſtreat.

      * Before the ſiluer corde be taken away, and the golden Ewer broken.

      * Before the Pytcher be broken at the well, and the wheele at the Ceſterne

      * And the duſt returne to the earth, as it was in the beginning.

      * And the ſpirit returne to God that gaue it.

      * Vanitie of vanities ſayth the Preacher, and all is but vanitie.

      * This Preacher was not onely wyſe, but alſo taught the people knowledge: he was very diligent, ſought

forth and gathered together many Parables.

      * He ſought to finde out pleaſaunt wordes, and vprightly to write the worde of trueth.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are lyke goades, and like nayles faſtened by the maſters of the Aſſemblies, and geuen by one Paſtour.

      * But are geuen by one Paſtour.

      * ¶ Of other bookes beſide theſe my ſonne take thou heede.

      * ¶ For there is none ende in making of bookes.

      * Much ſtudy and reading, is a wearines of the fleſhe.

      * Let vs heare the ende of all, feare God, and keepe his commaundementes.

      * ¶ For this is the dutie of all men.

      * For God wil bring euery worke vnto iudgement, with euery ſecreat thing, whether it be good or euell.

      * ¶ With euery ſecret thinge.

    _ The third Chapter.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * Though a man lyue many yeares, and in them all reioyce, yet he ſhall remember the dayes of darkenes, becauſe they are many, all that commeth is vanitie.

      * Be meary therfore O young man in thine youth, and let thine hart be glad in thine young daies.

      * Let thyne hart be glad.

      * Walke in the wayes of thyne hart,

      * And walk in the ſight of thine eyes

      * Put away greefe out of thyne hart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſhe: for childehode and youth are vanitie.

      * Put away euill from thy fleſhe.

      * For childehode and youth. &c.

      * ¶ Remember thy Creator now in thine youth, before the euell dayes come, & the yeares approch: where in thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

      * Whiles the ſonne is not darke, nor the light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, nor the Cloudes, returne after the rayne.

      * ¶ When the Reapers of the houſe ſhall tremble.

      * ❀And the ſtrong men ſhall bowe them ſelues.

      * When the Grinders ſhall ceaſe, becauſe

they are fewe.

      * ¶ And they waxe darke that looke out at the wyndowes.

      * And the ſtreat dores be ſhut without, & the baſe ſounde of the grinding waxe weake.

      * When they ſhall ryſe at the peping of the byrde, and all the daughters of ſinging ſhall waxe fainte.

      * The daughters of ſinging.

      * When the height ſhalbe afrayed, &

feare in the waye.

      * ¶ When the Almonde Tree ſhall floriſh.

      * ❀ When the Graſhopper ſhall be a burthen.

      * When pleaſure and delight abateth

      * For man ſhall goe into the houſe of his age, and the mourners ſhall goe about in the ſtreat.

      * Before the ſiluer corde be taken away, and the golden Ewer broken.

      * Before the Pytcher be broken at the well, and the wheele at the Ceſterne

      * And the duſt returne to the earth, as it was in the beginning.

      * And the ſpirit returne to God that gaue it.

      * Vanitie of vanities ſayth the Preacher, and all is but vanitie.

      * This Preacher was not onely wyſe, but alſo taught the people knowledge: he was very diligent, ſought

forth and gathered together many Parables.

      * He ſought to finde out pleaſaunt wordes, and vprightly to write the worde of trueth.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are lyke goades, and like nayles faſtened by the maſters of the Aſſemblies, and geuen by one Paſtour.

      * But are geuen by one Paſtour.

      * ¶ Of other bookes beſide theſe my ſonne take thou heede.

      * ¶ For there is none ende in making of bookes.

      * Much ſtudy and reading, is a wearines of the fleſhe.

      * Let vs heare the ende of all, feare God, and keepe his commaundementes.

      * ¶ For this is the dutie of all men.

      * For God wil bring euery worke vnto iudgement, with euery ſecreat thing, whether it be good or euell.

      * ¶ With euery ſecret thinge.

    _ The fifth Chapter.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * ¶Through ſlouthfulnes the balkes of the houſe decaye, and through Idle handes, it rayneth into the houſe.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * In the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and

in the euening let not thine hand reſt: For thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper this or that, or whether both ſhall be alyke good.

      * Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes, to ſee the Sunne.

      * Though a man lyue many yeares, and in them all reioyce, yet he ſhall remember the dayes of darkenes, becauſe they are many, all that commeth is vanitie.

      * Be meary therfore O young man in thine youth, and let thine hart be glad in thine young daies.

      * Let thyne hart be glad.

      * Walke in the wayes of thyne hart,

      * And walk in the ſight of thine eyes

      * Put away greefe out of thyne hart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſhe: for childehode and youth are vanitie.

      * Put away euill from thy fleſhe.

      * For childehode and youth. &c.

      * ¶ Remember thy Creator now in thine youth, before the euell dayes come, & the yeares approch: where in thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

      * Whiles the ſonne is not darke, nor the light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, nor the Cloudes, returne after the rayne.

      * ¶ When the Reapers of the houſe ſhall tremble.

      * ❀And the ſtrong men ſhall bowe them ſelues.

      * When the Grinders ſhall ceaſe, becauſe

they are fewe.

      * ¶ And they waxe darke that looke out at the wyndowes.

      * And the ſtreat dores be ſhut without, & the baſe ſounde of the grinding waxe weake.

      * When they ſhall ryſe at the peping of the byrde, and all the daughters of ſinging ſhall waxe fainte.

      * The daughters of ſinging.

      * When the height ſhalbe afrayed, &

feare in the waye.

      * ¶ When the Almonde Tree ſhall floriſh.

      * ❀ When the Graſhopper ſhall be a burthen.

      * When pleaſure and delight abateth

      * For man ſhall goe into the houſe of his age, and the mourners ſhall goe about in the ſtreat.

      * Before the ſiluer corde be taken away, and the golden Ewer broken.

      * Before the Pytcher be broken at the well, and the wheele at the Ceſterne

      * And the duſt returne to the earth, as it was in the beginning.

      * And the ſpirit returne to God that gaue it.

      * Vanitie of vanities ſayth the Preacher, and all is but vanitie.

      * This Preacher was not onely wyſe, but alſo taught the people knowledge: he was very diligent, ſought

forth and gathered together many Parables.

      * He ſought to finde out pleaſaunt wordes, and vprightly to write the worde of trueth.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are lyke goades, and like nayles faſtened by the maſters of the Aſſemblies, and geuen by one Paſtour.

      * But are geuen by one Paſtour.

      * ¶ Of other bookes beſide theſe my ſonne take thou heede.

      * ¶ For there is none ende in making of bookes.

      * Much ſtudy and reading, is a wearines of the fleſhe.

      * Let vs heare the ende of all, feare God, and keepe his commaundementes.

      * ¶ For this is the dutie of all men.

      * For God wil bring euery worke vnto iudgement, with euery ſecreat thing, whether it be good or euell.

      * ¶ With euery ſecret thinge.

    _ The Seuenth Chapter.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * But vnto mony all thinges are obedient.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * ¶Through ſlouthfulnes the balkes of the houſe decaye, and through Idle handes, it rayneth into the houſe.

      * With laughing thei get their liuing, and wyne maketh them meary.

      * Wyne maketh them meary.

      * But vnto mony all thinges are obedient.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * He that obſerueth the wynde ſhall not ſowe, and he that regardeth the Cloudes ſhall not reape.

      * As thou knoweſt not which is the waye of the Spirites, nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with Childe: So thou knoweſt not the worde of God that worketh all.

      * And how the bones be ioyned together.

      * In the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and

      * Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes, to ſee the Sunne.

      * Though a man lyue many yeares, and in them all reioyce, yet he ſhall remember the dayes of darkenes, becauſe they are many, all that commeth is vanitie.

      * Be meary therfore O young man in thine youth, and let thine hart be glad in thine young daies.

      * Let thyne hart be glad.

      * Walke in the wayes of thyne hart,

      * And walk in the ſight of thine eyes

      * Put away greefe out of thyne hart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſhe: for childehode and youth are vanitie.

      * Put away euill from thy fleſhe.

      * For childehode and youth. &c.

      * ¶ Remember thy Creator now in thine youth, before the euell dayes come, & the yeares approch: where in thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

      * Whiles the ſonne is not darke, nor the light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, nor the Cloudes, returne after the rayne.

      * ¶ When the Reapers of the houſe ſhall tremble.

      * When they ſhall ryſe at the peping of the byrde, and all the daughters of ſinging ſhall waxe fainte.

      * Vanitie of vanities ſayth the Preacher, and all is but vanitie.

      * This Preacher was not onely wyſe, but alſo taught the people knowledge: he was very diligent, ſought

forth and gathered together many Parables.

      * He ſought to finde out pleaſaunt wordes, and vprightly to write the worde of trueth.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are lyke goades, and like nayles faſtened by the maſters of the Aſſemblies, and geuen by one Paſtour.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Bleſſed art thou o lande, when thy king is the ſonne of Nobles, & thy Princes eate in tyme, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennes.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * ¶Through ſlouthfulnes the balkes of the houſe decaye, and through Idle handes, it rayneth into the houſe.

      * Curſe not the king in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber. for the ſoules of heauen ſhall carry thy voice, & they which haue wings ſhall bewraye it.

      * For the foules of heauen ſhall carry thy voyce, and they which haue winges ſhall bewray it.

      * Caſt thy breade vpon the waters, for after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it.

      * For after many dayes thou ſhalt finde it.

      * He that obſerueth the wynde ſhall not ſowe, and he that regardeth the Cloudes ſhall not reape.

      * As thou knoweſt not which is the waye of the Spirites, nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with Childe: So thou knoweſt not the worde of God that worketh all.

      * And how the bones be ioyned together.

      * In the morning ſowe thy ſeede, and

in the euening let not thine hand reſt: For thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper this or that, or whether both ſhall be alyke good.

      * Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes, to ſee the Sunne.

      * Though a man lyue many yeares, and in them all reioyce, yet he ſhall remember the dayes of darkenes, becauſe they are many, all that commeth is vanitie.

      * Be meary therfore O young man in thine youth, and let thine hart be glad in thine young daies.

      * Let thyne hart be glad.

      * Walke in the wayes of thyne hart,

      * And walk in the ſight of thine eyes

      * Put away greefe out of thyne hart, and cauſe euill to depart from thy fleſhe: for childehode and youth are vanitie.

      * Put away euill from thy fleſhe.

      * For childehode and youth. &c.

      * ¶ Remember thy Creator now in thine youth, before the euell dayes come, & the yeares approch: where in thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

      * Whiles the ſonne is not darke, nor the light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, nor the Cloudes, returne after the rayne.

      * ¶ When the Reapers of the houſe ſhall tremble.

      * Vanitie of vanities ſayth the Preacher, and all is but vanitie.

      * This Preacher was not onely wyſe, but alſo taught the people knowledge: he was very diligent, ſought

forth and gathered together many Parables.

      * He ſought to finde out pleaſaunt wordes, and vprightly to write the worde of trueth.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are lyke goades, and like nayles faſtened by the maſters of the Aſſemblies, and geuen by one Paſtour.

      * ¶The Preacher or oration of the ſon of Dauid, King of Hieruſalem.

      * ¶All is but moſt vaine vanitie ſayth the Preacher.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.

      * Whoſe Princes eate in their tyme.

      * Moſt vayne vanitie.

      * What hath a man of all the labour he taketh vnder the Sunne?

      * Vnder the Sunne.

      * One generation paſſeth away, and an other commeth, but the earth abydeth, or indureth ſtill.

      * The ſunne riſeth and goeth down, and returneth to hys place agayne breathyng, that hee may riſe vp agayn. The wynde goeth toward the South, and turneth to the North, fetcheth his compaſſe, whyrleth about, goeth forth, and returneth againe to his circuites from whence he dyd come.

      * And breathing againe to his place.

      * The wynde whyrleth and turneth about.

      * All flouds runne into the ſea, and yet the ſea runneth not ouer. The flouds returne to the place from whence they flowed, that they may from thence flow out agayne.

      * All thinges are hard to be knowen, neither is any man able to expreſſe them.

      * The eye is not ſatiſfied with ſeyng, nor the eare with hearyng.

      * What thing is that that hath been? euen the ſame that is to come. What is that that hath been done? euen the ſame that ſhall be done. And there is no new thyng vnder

the ſonne. Is there any thyng, wherof it may be ſayd, Loe, this is new, for the lyke hath been in the times that haue been before vs. There is no remembraunce of thinges paſt. no more ſhall there be any remembraunce of thynges to come hereafter.

      * What is that that hath been?

      * There is no new thing vnder the Sunne, neither any thing whereof it may be ſayd, loe, this is new.

      * There is no remembraunce of thinges paſſed.

      * I my ſelfe the preacher was a kyng of Iſraell at Hieruſalem, and dyd apply my mynde to ſeeke & ſearch out the knowledge of all thinges that are vnder heauen.

      * I did apply my minde to ſeeke and ſearch out the knowledge of all thynges, that are vnder the ſonne.

      * Such trauell and labour hath God giuen to the childrē of men, to exerciſe them ſelues therin.

      * I conſidered all the thyngs that are done vnder the ſunne, and lo, they are all but vanitie and vexation of mynde. Thynges crooked can not be ſtraight, nor the imperfection of thynges can be numbred.

      * Crookedneſſe can not bee made ſtraight, nor the imperfection in thynges be numbred.

      * I communed with mine owne hart ſaying: loe, I am come to great eſtate, and haue gotten more wiſedome then all they that haue been before me in Hieruſalem: yea my hart had great experience of wyſdome & knowledge, for therunto I applyed my mynde, that I might

know what were wiſdome and vnderſtanding, what errour and fooliſhnes, and I perceaued that this alſo was but a vexation of mynde: for where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell and diſquietnes, and the more knowledge a mā hath, the more is his care.

      * Wiſdome and knowledge.

      * Errour and fooliſhnes.

      * For where much wiſdome is, there is alſo great trauell.

      * Then ſayd I thus in my hart: go to, I will take myne eaſe, & haue good dayes. But loe, that is vanitie alſo.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will take myne eaſe.

      * I ſayd in my hart, I will goe, and and take my pleaſure.

      * I ſayd vnto the man geuē to laughter, thou art mad, and to the man geuen to mirth, what dooſt thou?

      * And I thought in myne hart to abſteine from wyne,Agaynſt Monkiſh lyfe. and to gouerne my hart wiſely, and to comprehēd fooliſhnes, vntill I might perceaue what was good for the children of men, to doe vnder heauen as long as they lyued.

      * And to gouerne my hart wiſely.

      * I made gorgeous fayre workes, I buylded me houſes, and planted vineyardes. I made me orchardes and gardens of pleaſure, and planted trees in thē of all maner frutes. I made pooles of water to water

the greene & frutefull trees withall. I bought ſeruātes and maydēs, & ſome I had borne at home. I bought cattle and ſheepe & had more ſubſtance then all they that were before me in Hieruſalem. I gathered togither ſiluer and golde, euen a treaſure of kynges and landes. I prouided mee ſingers and women that playde on inſtruments, to make men mirth and paſtime. I gat me Pſalteries & ſonges of Muſike, and I was greater and in more worſhippe, then all my predeceſſours In Hieruſalem. For wiſdome remayned with me, and looke whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it, and whatſoeuer my hart delyted, or had any pleaſure in, I withheld it not from it. Thus my hart reioyſed in all that I did, and thys was my portion of all my trauell. But when I cōſidered all my workes that my handes had wrought, and all the labour that I had taken therein, loe, all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde, and nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * I prouided me ſingers, and women playeng on Inſtrumentes, to make myrth and paſſe tyme.

      * And whatſoeuer myne eyes deſired, I let them haue it.

      * Loe all this was but vanitie, and vexation of mynde.

      * Nothyng of any value vnder the Sunne.

      * Then dyd I turne me, to conſider wiſedome, errour, and fooliſhnes. For what is hee among men, that

might be cōpared to me the kyng, in ſuch workes? And I ſawe that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhenes, as farre as light doth darkenes. For a wiſe man hath his eyes in his head, but the foole goeth in darkeneſſe. I perceaued alſo that they both had one end.

      * And I ſaw that wiſedome excelleth fooliſhneſſe as farre as light doth darkenes.

      * A wyſe man hath his eyes in hys head, but the foole. &c.

      * A wiſe man hath his eyes in his head.

      * For what man is able to imitate the kyng that made him before. &c.

      * And made vs before (to ſay) that we were.

      * And I ſaw that the ſucceſſe of both theſe men were alike.

      * Then ſayd I in my mynde, if it happen vnto the foole as it doth vnto me, what neede I labour then any more for wiſdome? So I ſayde in myne hart, that this alſo was but vanitie.

      * So I ſayd in mine hart this alſo was but vanitie.

      * For the wyſe are euer as little in remembraunce as the fooliſhe. For the dayes ſhall come, when all ſhal be forgotten.

      * And the wyſe man dyeth as well as the foole.

      * Wherefore I was weary of my lyfe becauſe I ſaw that all thinges done vnder the ſunne were naught. For all was but vanitie and vexation of mynde.

      * And I was weary of all my labour which I had takē vnder the ſunne, becauſe I ſhould be fayne to leaue them to an other man that commeth

after me, who whether hee ſhal be a wiſe mā or a foole I know not. And yet ſhall he be Lord of all my labours.

      * So I turned me to refrayne my mynde, from ſuch trauell as I had takē vnder the ſunne. For ſo much as a man ſhould weary hym ſelfe with wiſedome, with vnderſtandyng, and induſtrie, & yet be fayne to leaue his labours to an other, that neuer ſwet for them. This alſo is a vayne thyng and great miſerie. For what getteth a man of all the labour & trauell of his mynde, that hee taketh vnder the ſunne, but heauines, ſorow, and diſquietneſſe all the dayes of his lyfe. In ſo much that his hart can not reſt in the night. This is alſo a vayne thyng.

      * For when a man hath wearied him ſelfe, with wiſedome, vnderſtandyng, and diligence &c.

      * For what getteth a man of all hys trauell &c. This is but copy &c. Nor can reſt in the night.

      * Is it not better therefore for a man to eate and drinke, and his ſoule to be mery in his labour?

      * I ſaw that this was a gift of God.

      * For who hath eaten, or done more thinges abroad then I?

      * God geueth to the mā that is good before him, wiſdome, vnderſtanding, and gladneſſe. But vnto the ſinner he geueth wearines and ſuperfluous care, that he may gather and heape togither the thyng that afterward ſhalbe geuen vnto hym, whom it pleaſeth God. Wherfore, this alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * To all thinges there is an appointed tyme, and a tyme to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.

      * All thinges haue their tyme.

      * And euery purpoſe. &c.

      * There is a tyme to be borne, and a tyme to dye.

      * A tyme to plant, and a tyme to plucke vp.

      * A tyme to ſlea, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, & a time to buylde, a tyme to weepe, and a tyme to laughe: a time to mourne, and a tyme to daunce: a tyme to caſt away ſtones, and a tyme to gather ſtones: a tyme to embrace, & a tyme to abſteine frō embracyng: a time to ſeeke, and a tyme to loſe: a tyme to keepe, and a tyme to caſt away: a tyme to reape, and a tyme to ſow: a tyme to keepe ſilence, and a tyme to ſpeake: a tyme to loue, & a time to hate: a time of warre, and a tyme of peace.

      * What profite hath he that worketh of the thyng wherin he trauelleth?

      * I haue ſeene the trauell that God hath geuen the ſonnes of men, to humble them therby.

      * For God hath made all thynges beautifull in their time and ſeaſon.

      * Alſo he hath ſet the world in theyr hart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought frō the begynnyng to the end.

      * ¶ But man findeth not out the worke. &c.

      * And I know that there is nothyng good in them, but to reioyce and to doe good in his lyfe. And alſo that euery man eateth and drinketh, and ſeeth the cōmoditie of al his labour, this is the gift of God.

      * I know that whatſoeuer God ſhall doe, ſhall be for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it cā none diminiſh. For God hath done it, that they ſhould feare before him.

      * That that hath beene, is alſo nowe, and that that ſhall be, hath beene already, and God requireth the thinges that are paſt.

      * Becauſe God requireth the things that are paſt.

      * Moreouer, I ſaw vnder the Sunne, the place of iudgemēt, where was wickednes, and the place of iuſtice wher was iniquitie. And I thought in myne hart, God will iudge the iuſt and the wicked: for there is a tyme for euery worke & purpoſe.

      * There is a tyme for euery worke and purpoſe.

      * I conſidered in myne hart the ſtate of the children of men, that God

hath purged them: yet, to ſee to, they are in themſelues as beaſtes. For the condition of the children of mē, and the cōdition of beaſtes are euen as one. As the one dyeth: ſo dyeth the other.

      * The ſtate (or faſhion) of the children of men.

      * For the condition of the childrē of men, and of beaſtes are all as one.

      * As the beaſtes dye, ſo dye men.

      * For they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of mā aboue the beaſt. For all is vanitie. All goe to one place, & all was of the duſt, and all ſhall returne to the duſt.

      * All goe to one place &c.

      * Wherby he tryeth them.

      * Who knoweth whether the ſpirite of man aſcende vpwarde, and the ſpirite of the beaſt deſcend downward vnto the earth?

      * ¶Therefore I ſee that there is nothing better, then that a mā ſhould reioyſe in his affaires, becauſe that is his portion. For who ſhall bryng him to ſee, what ſhall be after him?

      * So I turned and conſidered all the oppreſsions that are wrought vnder the ſunne: & behold, the teares of the oppreſſed, and none cōforteth them, nor deliuered them out of the hādes of their oppreſſours, to comfort them.

      * Wherefore I prayſed thoſe that are dead, aboue thoſe that are lyuyng, and I coūted him that yet was vnborne better then them both. For he hath not ſeene the euill workes that are wrought vnder the ſunne.

      * Alſo I beheld all trauayle and perfectiō of workes, that is in the enuie of a mā againſt his neighbour: This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of the mynde.

      * I ſaw the induſtrie and perfection

that is in workemen.

      * This alſo is a vanitie and vexation of ſpirite.

      * The foole foldeth his handes, and eateth vp his owne fleſhe.

      * ¶The foole therefore foldeth hys handes.

      * He eateth his owne fleſh.

      * ¶Better is one handful with quietnes, then two handes full with labour and vexation of mynde.

      * I turned my ſelfe, and ſaw an other vanitie vnder the Sunne. There is one alone, and not a ſecond, which

hath neither ſonne nor brother: yet is there no ende of his trauell, neyther can his eyes bee ſatiſfied with riches, nether doth he thinke, for whom doe I trauell, & defraude my ſelfe of pleaſure? This alſo is vanitie, and an euill trauell.

      * There is one alone. &c.

      * It is better therefore there be two then one, for of their labour commeth ſome profite. For if one fall, his fellow will lift him vp. Wo vnto him that is alone. For when he falleth there is none to lift hym vp. And whē two ſleepe together, they ſhall one warme an other. But how ſhal one becom whot. And though one may ouercome one, yet two may make reſiſtaunce: a threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * ¶ A threefolde corde is not eaſely broken.

      * Better is a poore and wiſe childe, thē an old and fooliſh kyng, which will no more be admoniſhed.

      * For out of the priſon he commeth forth to reigne, where he that is borne a kyng loſeth the ſame.

      * I beheld all the lyuing which walke vnder the Sunne, with the ſeconde childe, which ſhall ſtand vp in hys place. There is none ende of all the people, and of all that were before them, & they that come after ſhall ſhall not reioyce in hym. This is alſo vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God, and draw nere to heare: for that is better then the Sacrifices of fooles,

for they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Take heede to thy foote, whē thou entreſt into the houſe of God.

      * For this is better then the ſacrifices of fooles.

      * For they know not how much hurt they doe.

      * Be not raſhe with thy mouth, nor let thyne hart be haſtye, to vtter a thing before God: for God is in heauen, and thou art on the earth. Therefore let thy wordes be fewe, for many cares breede dreames, and multitude of wordes declareth a foole.

      * Before God.

      * Dreaming commeth through multitude of cares.

      * And multitude of wordes bewrayeth a foole.

      * For God is in heauen, but thou art on the earth.

      * When thou haſt vowed a vowe vnto God, differre not to pay it, for he delighteth not in fooles. Paye therfore that thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou voweſt not, thē to vow, and not perfourme.

      * For he is not delighted in fooles.

      * Suffer not thy mouth to make thy fleſhe to ſinne, neyther ſay before the Angel, that this is ignoraunce, leaſt god be angry with thy ſaying, and deſtroy the woorkes of thyne handes. Many wordes are but dreames, and vanities, but feare thou the Lord.

      * Before the Angell.

      * If in a countrey thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgment and iuſtice, be not aſtonied at the matter. For he that is higher then the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher then they, and the King is ouer all the earth, ſo ſe the ground tylled.

      * Let not this matter trouble thee.

      * For he that is higher thē the higheſt regardeth.

      * To ſee the grounde tylled.

      * He that loueth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatiſfied with ſiluer, and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite therof: this alſo is a vanitie. When goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eate them: and what good cōmeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eyes?

      * Where much goods are. &c.

      * And what good commeth to the Owners thereof. &c.

      * The ſleepe of him that traueleth is ſweet, whether he eat litle or much but the ſacietie of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe.

      * I haue ſeene an euill ſicknes vnder the ſunne, to wyt, ryches conſerued to the owners for their euill. And theſe riches periſh by euell trauell, and he begetteth a ſonne, and in his hand is nothing.

      * They periſh with great calamitie.

      * And his borne of hym ſhall haue no poſſeſſion of him.

      * Euen as he came naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall he returne naked againe as he came, and ſhall beare away nothing of his labour. This is a vaine and miſerable thing that in all pointes as they came

they ſhall goe againe: & what profite hath he, that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * What profite hath he that he hath trauelled for the wynde?

      * All the dayes of his lyfe he eateth in darkenes, with much griefe, ſorrow and anger.

      * Therefore I ſee it is good for a man to eate and drinke, and to be meary in all his trauell that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the dayes of his life that God geueth him: for this is his portiō. But this is the gift of God, when he hath geuen man ryches and ſubſtance, and power to eate & drinke his part therof, and to reioyce in his labour.

      * For this is his portion. &c.

      * This is alſo an euill vnder the Sun, and much vſed among men: A mā to whom God hath geeuen ryches and treaſures, and honour, & wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that he deſireth, and yet God ſuffereth him not to eate thereof, but a ſtraunge man ſhall eate it vp. This is a vayne thing and a miſerable.

      * If he beget an hundreth children, and yet liue many yeares, and haue great riches al the dayes of his life, & yet his ſoule is not ſatiſfied with goods, and his body not buryed: I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then he. For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes, and his name ſhall be couered with darkenes.

      * And may want buryall.

      * I ſay that an vntymely fruite is better then ſuch an one.

      * For he commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darkenes.

      * And his name ſhall be couered in darkenes.

      * Alſo he hath not ſeene the Sunne nor can be quiet in any place.

      * Yea though he lyued two thowſād yeares, yet hath he no good lyfe. Come not all to one place.

      * Doo not all thinges goe. &c.

      * All the labour a man taketh is for him •elfe, and yet his ſoule is neuer ſatiſfied acording to her deſire

      * For what hath the wyſe man more then the foole, or what profyteth it the poore, that he knoweth how to walke before the Lyuing.

      * Or what profiteth it the poore?

      * The ſight of the eye is better then to walke after luſtes. This is alſo a vanitie and vexation of Spirite.

      * What is that that hath beene? The name thereof is now named, and it is knowen that it is man: and he cānot ſtriue with him, that is ſtronger then he.

      * For he can not ſtriue with him that is ſtronger then he.

      * For who knoweth what is good for mā liuing in the dayes of his vaine lyfe, which is but a ſhadow? Or who will tell a man, what ſhall happen after him vnder the Sonne?

      * Or who ſhall tell a man what ſhall happen. &c.

      * A good name is more worth then a precious oyntement, and the day of death is better then the daye of byrth.

      * Better is the day of death, then the day of byrth.

      * It is better to goe into a houſe of mourning, then into a houſe of feaſting. For there is the ende of all men.

      * And the liuing ſhal lay it to his hart

      * Anger is better then laughter, for by a ſad looke, the harte is made better.

      * Becauſe thorough a ſadde countenaunce, the hart is made better.

      * In the ſadnes of the countenaunce. &c.

      * The hart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning, but the hart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

      * In the houſe of mourning.

      * It is better to heare the rebuke of wiſe men then the ſong of fooles. For the laughing of fooles is lyke the cracking of thorns vnder a pot. This alſo is vanitye.

      * For lyke as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, ſo is the laughing of a foole.

      * This alſo is a vanitie.

      * For a ſclaunderer troubleth a wyſe man, and deſtroyeth a liberall or bountifull hart.

      * The ende of a matter is better then the beginning.

      * The Patient in ſpirite is better then the high minded.

      * Be not haſtyly angry in thy mynde, for anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶ Anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles.

      * ¶Saye not thou, why is it that the daies of olde time were better then theſe? For thou dooſt not enquyre wyſely of this thinge.

      * Wyſedome is good with an inheritaunce, and excellent to them that ſee the ſonne. For wiſedome defendeth, and ſo doth money. But wiſedome is much better, for it geueth life to him that hath it in poſſeſſion

      * Wiſdome with inheritaunce is better then they that ſee the Sunne.

      * Beholde the workes of God. Who can make ſtraight, that he hath made crooked?

      * Vſe well the tyme of proſperitie, and remember the day of miſfortune. For God hath made this as well as that, ſo that man can finde nothing after hym.

      * For as God made this, ſo made hee that alſo, after his manner and cuſtome.

      * That man can finde nothing after hym.

      * I haue ſeene all thinges in the daies of uanitie, there is a iuſt man that periſheth in his Iuſtice & a wicked man that contynueth long in his naughtines.

      * There is a iuſt man & he periſheth.

      * Be not iuſt ouermuch, neither make thy ſelf ouerwiſe, leaſt thou periſh. Be not ouermuch wycked, neyther

be thou fooliſh, leaſt thou dye before thy tyme.

      * ¶ Be not thou too wicked. &c.

      * It is good for thee to take holde of this, and not to let that goe out of thy hand: for he that feareth God, ſhall come forth with them all.

      * He that feareth God ſhall come forth of them all.

      * Wiſedome ſhall comfort the wyſe man more then tenne myghty men in the Citie.

      * Becauſe there is no mā on the earth that doth good and ſinneth not.

      * Take not heede vnto euery worde that is ſpoken, leaſt thou heare thy ſeuaūt curſe thee. For thine owne hart knoweth, that thou thy ſelfe alſo haſt often tymes ſpoken euill by other men.

      * Leaſt thou perhappes here thy Seruaunt curſſe thee.

      * All theſe thinges haue I proued by wyſedome, for I thought I would be wiſe, but it wēt the farther from me. It is farre of. What may it be? And it is a profounde deepenes, Who can finde it?

      * ¶It is a profound deepenes. &c.

      * I applied my minde alſo vnto knowledge, and to ſeeke and ſearch out ſcience, wyſedome and vnderſtanding, to know the fooliſhnes of the vngodly, and the errors of doting fooles.

      * And I finde the woman more bytter then death, whoſe hart is as nettes and ſnares, and her handes as bandes. He that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her, but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her.

      * Beholde (ſayth the Preacher) thys haue I founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the count, & yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I finde it not. I haue

founde one man among a thouſād, but a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * But a woman haue I not founde among them all.

      * Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made mā righteous, but they haue ſought many Inuentions

      * But they haue ſought many inuentions.

      * Who is wiſe, and who can declare theſe thinges?

      * The wiſedome of a man maketh his face to ſhine, but vnſhamefaſtnes putteth it out of fauour.

      * Keepe the kynges Commaundement I warne thee, and the othe that thou haſt made to God.

      * Be not haſty to goe out of his ſight, nor ſtand not in an euill thing, for he will doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. Where the word of the king is, there is power. And who ſhall ſay vnto him, what dooſt thou?

      * Stand not in an euill matter.

      * For he doth what pleaſeth hym.

      * Whatſoeuer lyketh hym, that wyll he doe.

      * For the kinges worde is myghty.

      * He that keepeth his commaundement ſhall know none euell thing.

      * The harte of the wicked diſcerneth tyme and iudgement.

      * For to euery purpoſe there is a time and iudgement: for great is the miſery of man vpō him. For he knoweth not that which ſhall be, & Who can tell him when it ſhall be?

      * For great is the miſery of hym (that obeyeth not the kinges commaundement) for he knoweth not that which ſhall be.

      * For man is not Lorde ouer the Spirit, to retayne the ſpirit, neyther hath he power in the day of death, nor deliueraunce in the battel, neither ſhall wickednes deliuer the poſſeſſers thereof.

      * Wickednes can not deliuer the poſſeſſours thereof.

      * All theſe things haue I conſidered, and haue geuen my mynde vnto euery worke that is vnder the ſūne, and I ſawe how one man hath lordſhipp ouer an other to his owne harme.

      * Lykewiſe I ſawe the wicked buryed, which walked in the holy place, and they were forgotten, that they had ſo behaued themſelues. This alſo was a vanitie.

      * I ſaw the wicked buryed.

      * Becauſe ſentence agaynſt an euyll worke is not executed ſpeedely,

therfore the hart of the children of mē is fully ſet in them to doe euill.

      * But though a ſinner offend an hundreth tymes, and God prolong hys dayes, yet I know that it ſhall goe well with them that feare the lord, and doe reuerence before him. But it ſhall not be well to the wicked, neyther ſhall he prolong his dayes: he ſhall be lyke a ſhadowe, becauſe he feareth not God.

      * ¶ And his dayes ſhall not be prolonged.

      * ¶There is a vanitie alſo which is done vpon the Earth: that is, there be righteous men to whom it happeneth as if they did the workes of the wicked: and there be alſo wycked to whom it commeth as if they did the workes of the iuſt, & I ſayd: This alſo is a vanitye.

      * Therefore I prayſed myrth & gladnes becauſe a man hath no better thing vnder the ſonne, then to eate and drinke, & to reioyce. For this

is all he hath of his labour, all the dayes of his lyfe, that God geueth him vnder the Sunne.

      * And I applyed my mynde to know wiſedome, and to beholde the buſines that is done on the earth, that neyther daye nor night the eyes of man take ſleepe.

      * Then I conſydered all the workes of God, how man can not fynd out the worke that is wrought vnder the Sun. But the more he laboureth to ſearche it, the leſſe he findeth, yea and although he thinke himſelf wiſe inough, yet he can not finde it.

      * All theſe thinges I caſt in mine hart to vnderſtand. There are righteous

men and wiſe, whoſe ſeruaunts are in the hand of God, and yet no mā knoweth the loue or the hatred of that that is before him.

      * And yet no man knoweth whether he is loued or hated.

      * They haue both lyke ſucceſſe. For it happeneth to the righteous euen as to the wicked, to the good & cleane as to the vncleane, to him that offreth, as to him that offreth not. As it happeneth to the vertuous, euen ſo to the ſinners: to him that forſweareth, as to him that feareth an othe. This is the woorſte of all thinges that are donne vnder the Sunne, that it happeneth to all men alyke. Whereby the hart of man is fylled with wickednes, and fooliſhnes remaineth in their harts, all the

dayes of their lyfe.

      * This is the woorſt of all things that are donne vnder the Sunne.

      * This is the cauſe therefore that mēs hartes are fylled with wyckednes:

      * And fooliſhnes remayneth in their hartes vntill they dye.

      * For among all men lyuing, hope is choſen, for a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For a lyuing dogge is better then a dead Lyon.

      * For the lyuing know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at

all, neyther haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembraunce is forgotten. Alſo their loue and their hatred and their enuy is now periſhed, and they haue no more portion for euer in all that is done vnder the Sunne.

      * The dead know nothing at all, neither are they rewarded any more.

      * They haue no more any rewarde.

      * ¶ Their loue their hatred. &c.

      * ¶ Moreouer they haue no parte or portion in this worde.

      * Goe therefore and eate thy breade with ioy, and drinke thy wine wyth a cherefull hart. For now thy works pleaſe God.

      * ¶ For thy workes pleaſe God.

      * At all tymes let thy garmentes bee white, and let thyne heade be anoynted with oyle.

      * And anoynt thy hed with oyle.

      * Reioyce with the wife whom thou haſt loued all the dayes of the lyfe of thy vanitie, which God hath geuen thee vnder the Sunne, all the dayes of thy vanitie. For this is thy portion in the lyfe, and in thy trauell wherein thou laboureſt vnder the Sunne.

      * All that thyne hand ſhall finde to doe, doe wyth all thy power: for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue whether thou goeſt.

      * For in the graue there is no worke.

      * And I turned me vnto other things done vnder the ſunne, and I ſawe that in rūning, it helpeth not to be ſwifte, in battell not to be ſtrong, to get liuing, not to be carefull, to get riches not to be wiſe, to be had in fauour, it helpeth not to be cunning, but that all lyeth in tyme and fortune.

      * To be had in fauour it helpeth not to be cunning.

      * The Succeſſe of all thinges dependeth on fortune.

      * Man knoweth not his tyme, but as the fyſhes which are takē with the angle, & as birdes that are catched with ſpringeſſe, ſo are they ſnared in the perelous tyme, when it cometh ſvddenly vpon them.

      * And as fiſhes. &c.

      * This wiſdome alſo haue I ſeene vnvnder the Sunne, and me thought it a great thinge. There was a lyttle Citie, and a fewe men within it: So there came a great kinge and beſeeged it, & made great fortes againſt it: and in the Citie there was found a pore mā, but wiſe, which through his wiſdōe deliuered the Citie: Yet was there no body that had any reſpecte vnto ſuch a ſimple man. Then ſayde I, wyſedome is better then ſtrength. Neuertheles a poore mās wyſdome is deſpiſed, & his wordes are not heard.

      * And no man remembred the man.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.

      * The wordes of the wyſe are hearde in quietnes. &c.

      * Better is wiſdome then weapons of warre, but one ſinner deſtroyeth much good.

      * For one Synner deſtroyeth much good.

      * Dead flyes cauſe the moſt precious oyntment to ſtinke.

      * Therefore a lytle folly ſometyme, is better then wiſdome and glory.

      * ¶ The harte of a wiſe man is as his

right hande, but the hart of a foole is at his left.

      * A foole walking in the way and being him ſelfe neuer ſo much a foole thynketh yet that all other are fooles.

      * Therefore if the ſpirit of thy ſuperiour haue his purpoſe againſt thy mynde: be not thou diſcontented, for to giue place pacifieth great euill.

      * ❀ There is a great euell that I haue ſeene vnder the Sunne, namely ignorance, that is much ſeene among Princes. For ſome foole is aduaūced to great honour, and the riche ſyt in the duſt. I haue ſeene ſeruāts on horſe backe and ſome Princes lyke ſeruauntes goe on foote.

      * He that diggeth a pit ſhall fall into it, and he that breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhal ſting him. He that remoueth ſtones ſhall hurt himſelfe thereby, & he that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereby.

      * He that remooueth ſtones.

      * He that cleaueth wood, ſhall be in daunger thereof.

      * If the yron be ſo blunt, that one can not ſharpen it, he muſt then put to more ſtrength: but the excellencie to directe a thing is wiſdome.

      * If the Serpent byte when he is not charmed, no better is a babler and blab of tounge:

      * The wordes of a wyſe mans mouth haue grace, but the lips of a foole deuoureth him.

      * ❀ The beginning of his woordes is fooliſhnes, and the latter ende of his taulke is madnes.

      * ¶ The foole multiplieth woordes.

      * ¶ Man knoweth not what is before him, & who can tell him what ſhall be after him?

      * The labour of the fooliſhe doth weary him, for hee knoweth not how to get into the Citie.

      * They know not how to goe into the Citie.

      * Woe to thee ó land, when thy king is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.

      * Whoſe princes eat in the morning.
