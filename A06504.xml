            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It ſhal not be aſked at that dreadful day when we ſhall come to make our aunſwere to almighty God, how much we haue learned, how oft we haue read, how much we do know, but how well we haue liued, what workes we haue expreſſed to teſtifie with vs of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde regeneration, of our inwarde fayth, that he might be thereby glorified.

The other was by reaſon they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt in the Hebrew toung, &amp; in the auctors peculiar phraſe, whiche many tymes ſwarueth from the common phraſe of ſpeach, and differeth much from the cuſtome of our tounge.<note place="margin">The vſe of this booke.</note> Hereby it came to paſſe, that the booke which for many cauſes was worthy to be had in all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and ſpecially to be knowen to all gouernours of common weales (for in it was moſt liuely ſet forth and in no place like, the adminiſtration of affaires aſwell publike as priuate) hath hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been depriued of his name and dignitie, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vnregarded and neglected, ſo that to this day, we haue had neither vſe nor commoditie of

it. So much hath the raſhnes and ignoraunce of ſome men been able to do. Wherfore our firſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhalbe to hold faſt the certeine ſcope &amp; inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the booke, what it requireth and whereto it tendeth.

For it is but a ſory contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde, to lyue ſolitarily, and out of the company of men. It is no contempt of golde to caſt it away, or to abſteyne from touchyng of money, as dyd the Franciſcanes: but he in deede contemneth it that vſing it euery day, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away wyth the greedy deſier of it.

                  <note place="margin">What the matter and content of this booke is.</note>To be plaine therfore, the ſubiect and matter of the booke is, that mankynde is ſo fooliſh, that he deſireth and ſearcheth after his owne wayes many thynges which he can not compaſſe and bryng to paſſe, or if he bring them to paſſe, he can not enioy them, but poſſeſſeth them with care &amp; loſſe, not thorough any fault in the thynges, but by reaſon of his moſt fooliſhe affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; deſiers.

The ſentence is as it were a thunderbolte againſt all rules, and Monkiſh religions, whereby they make thoſe thinges in ſubiection to them and their deuiſes, whiche are not theirs. Not that abſtinence is an euill thing, but to ſéeke it of our own deuiſes, and to binde our ſelues to them as vnto thinges neceſſary. For tyme, creature, place &amp;c. are the giftes of God, which yet theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will captiuate with their rules and preſcriptions. Howbeit they get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therby, but ſorrow &amp; miſery while they afflict their body, &amp; vexe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues

                  <p>And for a man to rule himſelfe after his owne deuiſe, is but a vanitie,<note place="margin">It is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie for a man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne hym ſelfe after his owne deuiſe.</note> nay he two maner of wayes hurteth himſelfe.

                     </hi> therefore compareth this life to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not to the lyfe to come, &amp; ſaith: If we ſhall conſider the lyfe of man, then it is true that the day of death is better then the day of byrth. For what greater euil can happen to a man, then that thoſe which are in office, and doe all they can with all their hart for the behoofe of the common weale, and ſuffer whatſoeuer thinges for the common weales ſake, yet at the length finde nothing but all kynde of ingratefulnes, contempt, loſſe, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. &amp;c.</p>
